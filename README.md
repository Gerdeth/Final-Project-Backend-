Final-Project-Backend is the backend portion to the Paper-trade-frontend.
This backend is built with the languages Python, a python micro-framework named Flask.
This app links to the frontend to display data to multiple pages of the project.
Such as My Stocks and Transaction History.

The backend also displays the dynamic username that the user has created.
We have made multiple get requests to get data from the backend and display it on the front.
A delete request to delete to sell a stock or remove any information necessary.
A put request to update any information needed like the email or password.
A post request that add information needed such as when you first create an account for the application.
A get request to get any addition information.
